## Accessibility Improvements
To ensure that the Horiseon website is accessible, the following steps were taken:

1. **Semantic HTML Elements**: The source code of the website has been updated to include semantic HTML elements. This helps in making the website more accessible and improves search engine optimization (SEO).

2. **Logical Structure**: HTML elements have been structured logically, independent of styling and positioning. This ensures that the website is easily navigable and usable for all visitors, including those using assistive technologies.

3. **Accessible Alt Attributes**: All image and icon elements now contain accessible `alt` attributes. This provides meaningful descriptions for these elements to assist users who rely on screen readers.

4. **Sequential Headings**: Heading elements have been organized to fall in a sequential order, which aids in content structure and accessibility.

5. **Descriptive Title Element**: The `<title>` element has been updated to contain a concise and descriptive title for the webpage. This improves user experience and SEO.

## CSS Code Reorganization
The CSS code has also been improved:

1. **Added Comments**: Comments have been added throughout the CSS code to explain the purpose and usage of various selectors and styles. This makes it easier for developers to understand and modify the code in the future.

2. **Selector Reorganization**: The CSS selectors have been reorganized to reduce redundancy and improve code maintainability.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the Horiseon website.
- `assets` folder: Contains the CSS file (`style.css`) and any image/icon assets.
- `README.md`: This README file, providing information about the project.
